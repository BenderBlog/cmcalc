CMCalc flagship version: Qalculate! frontend in Android and iOS

This program is the beginning a series of calculator software called CMCalc, a attempt to bring 
FOSS Computer Algebra System to the mobile platform (iOS and Android). It is now working in 
progress, and I am doing my best to cover all the functionality available to the end users.

The CMCalc project's goal includes:
 - A Flutter frontend for CAS in the mobile platform
 - Wrapper library for the CAS libraries

Planning product:
 - [Qalculate!](http://qalculate.github.io/)
 - [eigenmath](https://georgeweigt.github.io/)

Hopes an adorable and cute girl with [pretty blue eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1of21efNtk) 
helps me, where is she...
